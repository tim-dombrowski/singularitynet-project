# SingularityNET Ecosystem Financial Analysis

### Overview

For this project, the focus will be to examine the financial performance of various crypto-tokens in the [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/) [Ecosystem](https://singularitynet.io/ecosystem/). This AI ecosystem has issued several digital tokens that each aim to create a marketplace around a particular AI application. This collection of application-specific AI markets has a goal of ["creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence. An ‘AGI’ that is not dependent on any central entity, that is open for anyone and not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country."](https://singularitynet.io/aboutus/) For more detail on the history of the project, check out the [SingularityNET Blog Archive](https://blog.singularitynet.io/archive), which goes back to the [initial announcement in October 2017](https://blog.singularitynet.io/why-we-are-building-singularitynet-e0095292b3f1).

### Additional Context Around the Data

The primary token of the ecosystem is the **SingularityNET token (AGIX)** (formerly AGI), [which launched on the Ethereum blockchain in late 2017](https://blog.singularitynet.io/announcing-the-singularitynet-token-sale-5ae1b5540bd2). This [initial coin offering (ICO)](https://search.brave.com/search?q=initial+coin+offering) [raised $36M (in ETH) in 66 seconds](https://cointelegraph.com/news/singularitynet-ico-cap-dwarfed-by-150-mln-pledges). This [blog post from November 2017](https://blog.singularitynet.io/exploring-the-utility-of-singularitynets-agi-token-2006639ccd40) describes the initial, intended use-cases for the AGI token. Then, in 2021, [the original AGI token was forked to a new contract/token with the AGIX symbol](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-phase-ii-launch-sequence-activated-agi-token-to-be-hard-forked-to-10ede4b6c89). This new contract added functionality to make the tokens cross-chain compatible. As of mid-2023, the AGIX token has been bridged to the Cardano blockchain, and the SDAO token (discussed below) has been bridged to the Binance Smart Chain.

The first spin-off token to launch in the SingularityNET ecosystem was the **SingularityDAO token (SDAO)**. [SingularityDAO](https://www.singularitydao.ai/) was [announced in late 2020](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-announces-singularitydao-8210ea3fd1ff) with the goal of being the decentralized finance (DeFi) component of the ecosystem. Since many of the subsequent token generation events (TGEs) has taken place on the SingularityDAO platform, this was a logical first step to building out the ecosystem. This TGE had two components: (1) an ICO with purchase caps that correspond to one's AGIX holdings, and (2) an airdrop to AGIX holders that could be claimed without any incurred costs beyond acquiring the AGIX tokens. In both cases, the TGE lasted several months. For ICO participants, the tokens purchased were subject to a 12-month linear vesting schedule (1/12 of the tokens unlocked for trading every month). Then the airdrops to AGIX holders took place over four distributions during 2021 (one each month from May-August). 

The next spin-off project to launch was [NuNet](https://www.nunet.io/) and its **NuNet token (NTX)**, which aims to build a decentralized computing platform (think AirBNB for GPUs). The [project announcement](https://medium.com/nunet/why-we-are-launching-nunet-20969ba1c759) actually dates back to late 2019; however, the NTX token launch was [announced in late 2021](https://medium.com/nunet/nunets-ntx-utility-token-launch-2217147c40ca) after SingularityDAO completed their TGE. The NTX TGE was fairly similar to the SDAO TGE in that there was an ICO component (slightly different vesting schedule) and an airdrop component for AGIX holders, which took place throughout 2022. However, following the development of the [AGIX ERC-20 Converter Bridge](https://blog.singularitynet.io/the-agix-erc-20-converter-bridge-is-live-fa90ccba061a) in early 2022, the NTX token was launch was split across the Ethereum and Cardano blockchains. So 63.125% of the token supply was issued on the Ethereum blockchain, and the remaining 36.875% was issued on the Cardano blockchain. The token holders can then use the bridge to move tokens back-and-forth between blockchains. 

Then in 2023, several additional spinoff tokens launched, including the **Rejuve token (RJV)**, **HyperCycle token (HYPC)**, **Cogito Protocol token**, and **Sophiaverse token**. [Rejuve](https://rejuve.ai/), [HyperCycle](https://www.hypercycle.ai/), [Cogito Protocol](https://www.cogito.finance/), and [Sophiaverse](https://www.sophiaverse.ai/). Each of these projects has a different AI-related focus aiming to build specialized AI projects within the SingularityNET ecosystem. The [Rejuve project](https://rejuve.ai/) is a health and longevity-focused project, the [HyperCycle project](https://www.hypercycle.ai/) is focused on building the communication layer for AI agents, the [Cogito Protocol](https://www.cogito.finance/) is focused on asset tokenization for DeFi applications, and the [Sophiaverse](https://www.sophiaverse.ai/) is focused on blockchain-based gaming.

### Repository Structure

The data work for this project demo is contained in the R Notebook directory of this repository. On GitHub, the webpage should display the README.md file, which contains the compiled output of the R Notebook. If you wish to explore the source code locally, then you can open the tokencomps.Rmd file in RStudio and execute the code chunks to replicate the data work. Note the `output: html_notebook` line in the header of that file, which indicates that the R Markdown document is an R Notebook. 

After exploring the R Notebook and making any desired changes, you can then create a copy that will appear on GitHub. To do this, save a copy of the R Notebook and name it README.Rmd. Then, change the header line to `output: github_document`, which will switch the file from being an R Notebook to an R Markdown file that will compile into a generic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file (.md). This format (along with the README name) will automatically be recognized by GitHub and displayed in-browser. This will also replace the Preview button with an option to Knit the Markdown file. This knitting process will re-run all the code chunks and generate a new README.md file inside of the R Notebook folder, which will display on GitHub.
